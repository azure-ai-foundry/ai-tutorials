# üîß Welcome to Generative AI and Agents Tutorials

This repo includes a collection of tutorials to help you get started with building Generative AI applications using **Azure AI Foundry**.
Each tutorial is designed to be self-contained and provides step-by-step instructions to guide you in the development process.

## What is Azure AI Foundry?

[Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) is the ultimate platform for innovators to create generative AI solutions. It offers a comprehensive suite of Azure AI capabilities and tools to design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents. It's seamlessly integrated with the world's most loved developer tools, including GitHub, Visual Studio, and Copilot Studio. 
It offers a low-code development experience via a [web portal](https://ai.azure.com) and a rich set of APIs and SDKs for advanced users.

- [Lab 1 - Interacting with multimodal models and agents](./Lab%201%20-%20Interacting%20with%20multimodal%20models%20and%20agents/): in this lab, designed for devs getting started in their gen AI journey, you'll get hands-on experience with Azure AI Foundry by interacting with the latest multimodal models from the model catalog. Learn prompt engineering techniques to effectively generate text, sound, and images, and mitigate the risks of inaccurate or harmful responses. Create an LLM-powered agent via UI, to combine gen AI capabilities with data connectors and tools, enabling the agent to take actions on behalf of the user.

- [Lab 2 - Build your code-first agent with Azure AI Foundry](./Lab%202%20-%20Build%20your%20code-first%20agent%20with%20Azure%20AI%20Foundry/): this hands-on lab equips AI developers to create a powerful LLM-based agent with the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. This fully managed cloud service simplifies enterprise-ready and scalable AI agent development, by tackling the challenge of integrating with complex data sources and multimodal models. By going through this lab, attendees will learn how to develop and test an agentic AI able to answer sales-related queries, analyze data, generate visualizations, and integrate external data sources.
